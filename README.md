# BirdingLocal
Birding Local is an iOS app that leverages the eBird API to provide users with recent nearby bird sightings

Roadmap:
- [x] V1: Core in-app experience: fetch recent sightings near the user's current location from a fixed (5 mi) radius using the eBird API and Wikipedia API.
- [x] V2: Enable location and radius editing.
- [ ] V3: SwiftUI widget to display sightings on the Home Screen.
